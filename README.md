# VECTOR CALCULATOR

**Developed by Anthony Higareda**
**For CPE2600-111, Systems Programming**

Create 3-dimensional vectors and perform mathematical functions on them.
This program uses dynamic memory to store a near-infinite amount of vectors.

Mathematical Functions Available:
- Addition
  > c = a + b
- Subtraction
  > c = a - b
- Scalar Multiplication
  > a * 9
- Dot Product
  > a . b
- Cross Product
  > c = a X b

A note about the required syntax:
All terms and symbols must be separated by one and ONLY one space or comma

System Functions Available:
- Load
  > Read vectors into memory from a .csv file
- Save
  > Save all vectors in memory to a .csv file
- Clear
  > Remove all vectors from memory
- List
  > Display all vectors in memory
- Quit
  > Exit the program
